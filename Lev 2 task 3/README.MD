# TODO List Application

This is a simple and elegant TODO List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks with a sleek user interface. Tasks are stored in the browser's **localStorage**, so your list stays intact even after refreshing the page or closing the browser. The app features smooth UI interactions, a responsive input layout, and accessibility-friendly controls. Itâ€™s a great beginner-friendly project for learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and local data persistence in JavaScript.
