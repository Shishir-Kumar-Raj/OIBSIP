          <h2>Military career</h2>
          <p>
            Batra joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun, in June 1996 in the Manekshaw Battalion. After
            completing his 19-month training course, he graduated from the IMA on 6 December 1997 and was commissioned
            as a lieutenant into the Indian Army. He was commissioned into the 13th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir
            Rifles (13 JAK Rif). After commissioning, he was sent to Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh for regimental training. 
            The training lasted one month, from December 1997 to the end of January 1998.
            On completion of this training he got his first posting at Sopore in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir, an
            area with significant militant activity. In mid-March 1998, he was sent to the Infantry School at Mhow, Madhya
            Pradesh, where young Army officers are trained, for the Young Officer's Course. This training lasted five months
            until September 1998. Following completion of the course and being awarded alpha grading, he joined his battalion
            in Sopore in October 1998.
            During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with militants. In one of those encounters when Batra
            was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped when bullet fired by a militant
            grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, who was killed.  Batra ordered his men to fire on 
            the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed. He believed that the bullet was meant for 
            him and not his colleague.
            In January 1999, Batra was sent on a Commando Course at Belgaum, Karnataka. The course lasted for two months
            and at the end of it, he was awarded the highest grading — the Instructor's Grade.
            Every time when he came home to Palampur on leave, he would visit the Neugal Cafe. Batra last came home
            on leave from the army in 1999, during the Holi festival for a few days.
            After his leave, he returned to join his battalion in Sopore. The 13 JAK Rif, after completing its
            counter-insurgency operations tenure in Kashmir under 192 Mountain Brigade of 8 Mountain Division, received orders
            to proceed to Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The battalion's advance party under Major Yogesh Kumar Joshi had
            reached its destination, when on 5 June, because of the outbreak of the war, its deployment orders were changed
            and the battalion received orders to move to Dras.
            Batra informed his parents about his movement and assured them they need not worry about him. He would call
            his parents at least once in ten days. The last phone call he made was on 29 June 1999. This was the last
            time that Batra spoke to his mother.
            Beginning his service as a lieutenant, he rose to the rank of Captain.

          <h2>Param Vir Chakra</h2>
          <p>
            Vikram Batra was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour on 15 August 1999, the 52nd
            anniversary of India's independence. His father G.L. Batra received the honour for his deceased son from the
            President of India, the late K. R. Narayanan.

            <b>The Param Vir Chakra citation reads as follows:</b>
            During 'Operation Vijay', on 20 June 1999, Captain Vikram Batra, Commander Delta Company was tasked to attack 
            Point 5140. Captain Batra with his company skirted around the feature from the East and maintaining surprise reached 
            within assaulting distance of the enemy. Captain Batra reorganized his column and motivated his men to physically 
            assault the enemy positions. Leading from the front, he in a daredevil assault, pounced on the enemy and killed
            four of them in a hand-to hand fight. On 7 July 1999, in another operation in the area Pt 4875, his company was
            tasked to clear a narrow feature with sharp cuttings on either side and heavily fortified enemy defences that covered 
            the only approach to it. For speedy operation, Captain Batra assaulted the enemy position along a narrow ridge and 
            engaged the enemy in a fierce hand –to-hand fight and killed five enemy soldiers at point blank range. 
            Despite sustaining grave injuries, he crawled towards the enemy and hurled grenades clearing the position with utter 
            disregard to his personal safety, leading from the front, he rallied his men and pressed on the attack and achieved a 
            near impossible military task in the face of heavy enemy fire. The officer, however, succumbed to his injuries. 
            Inspired by his daredevil act, his troops fell upon the enemy with vengeance, annihilated them and captured Point 4875.

            Captain Vikram Batra, thus, displayed the most conspicuous personal bravery and leadership of the highest order in the 
            face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice in the highest traditions of the Indian Army.
